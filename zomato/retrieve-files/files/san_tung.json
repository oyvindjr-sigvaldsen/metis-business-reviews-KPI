(Yes, feel free to judge me online strangers :P) \n\nAlso had the Pork Dumplings - eh, were just okay. These dumplings are of the thicker skin type and served boiled. While they may have looked plump and juicy, I felt the pork filling had a little bit of a bitter aftertaste...overall, not a fan. \n\nThe combination Chow Mein, on the other hand, was good - better than most of the chow mein I've had at other Chinese restaurants in SF. Also worth getting are their Sauteed String Beans, tender and crispy fresh with a nicely charred taste - very yummy!\n\nSang Tung holds true to their reputation for long lines, though. Evidence? Our starving group of 6 came just a little before 5 and smartly thought we would beat the dinner crowd. Nope, wrong - we still had to wait an hour before we got seated. \n\nWorth it though, in my opinion~\n\n","id":25154824,"restaurant_id":16849865,"rating_color":"5BA829","review_time_friendly":"Oct 07, 2015","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Oct 07, 2015","rating_text":"Great!","timestamp":1444206554,"review_time":"2015-10-07 13:59:14","liked_by_user":0,"likes":1,"user":{"id":30054372,"name":"Veronica \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf70","zomato_handle":"Vline","foodie_level":"Big Foodie","foodie_level_num":6,"foodie_color":"ffae4f","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":108,"no_of_beenthere":61,"no_of_reviews":32,"no_of_followers":51,"no_of_follows":7,"no_of_photos":109,"no_of_media":109,"no_of_favorites":7,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"email","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/0ef\/2daeeaf609bb06f4a65524e9881f80ef.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/0ef\/2daeeaf609bb06f4a65524e9881f80ef.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"Veronica \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf70","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":4,"review_text":"It looks a cheap restaurant from the outside \ud83d\ude05 and I was disgusted by the smell from the inside.\nHowever; the food was soooo delicious.

I expected a great dining experience and that's what I got. We showed up late Sunday night, maybe 9:PM, and were seated against the wall to observe the lively environment filled with happy diners. We were promptly brought tea and almost immediately afterwards received our ice cold beers served up in equally ice cold glasses. Soon we got out hot and sour soup, dry fried chicken, spinach, another beer, and some rice. We thought that we may have ordered too much but gleefully gobbled everything down. The service was not the usual dump-the-food-on-the table. Food was placed on the table and confirmed for its correctness by a smiling waitstaff while removing and empty plates or glasses. Although I was a little tired and perhaps a little cranky, I was treated well and I left the restaurant happy and full. I've been meaning to come here for over a year and only regret not coming here back then.
