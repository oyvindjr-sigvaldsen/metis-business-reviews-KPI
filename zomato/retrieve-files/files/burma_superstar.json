Recommendation from a friend and a intriguing menu with significant vegetarian options were all the incentives we needed to land up at the Burma Superstar on Clement Street.\n\nWe called in early to put our name on the waitlist (2 hours). A critical requirement on a Saturday evening. Reached at 9 pm and still had to wait for ~30 mins also cos we were a large party of 7 and people on Table 34 just refused to get up even after finishing their food.\n\nAnyways, the hostess kindly squeezed us in into a table of 6 and we were grateful given the strong, cold SF winds blowing on the streets outside.\n\nFirst up was the Vegetarian Samusa Soup. We ordered it more out of curiosity as we hadn&rsquo;t ever heard of a Samosa in a soup. Warm and very soupy with pieces of veg samosas and falafels thrown in. Delicious!! Gotta get the recipe cos wife can&rsquo;t argue with the health benefits of a soup!!\n\nThe Mango salad was a safe option and went further by being a notch or two better than safe. The Lettuce Cups were just as good as one has had anywhere else.\n\nThe Plathas were a bit of a dampener (being used to the similar roti canai variation) as they were quite oily.\n\nWe are half full before main course thanks to the Sumptuous Samusa Soup. Still the Fiery Vegetables with Tofu which they made it in a not so fiery style given we had kids in the party. Went very well with the Tan Poi - rice with cardamoms, raisins, etc. The Vegetable Curry Delux was more like a potato subzi with lots of ras (liquidy gravy sort of thing) and was probably the only dish we didn&rsquo;t finish.\n\nThe great food was only surpassed by the staff&rsquo;s ever smiling and super helpful attitude (even after 5 hours of super hectic service). \n\nA total superstar!!","id":35601784,"restaurant_id":16841211,"rating_color":"305D02","review_time_friendly":"May 25, 2018","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"May 25, 2018","rating_text":"Insane!","timestamp":1527224157,"review_time":"2018-05-25 10:25:57","liked_by_user":0,"likes":0,"user":{"id":1705824,"name":"Nikhil Mohta","zomato_handle":"","foodie_color":"ffae4f","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":44,"no_of_beenthere":35,"no_of_reviews":18,"no_of_followers":185,"no_of_follows":10,"no_of_photos":8,"no_of_media":8,"no_of_favorites":10,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"email","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/5e3\/9bd4f7f48501ea9aa69b9322d297b5e3.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/5e3\/9bd4f7f48501ea9aa69b9322d297b5e3.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"Nikhil Mohta","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[{"user":{"id":641748,"name":"Surabhi Mohta","active":1}},{"user":{"id":1488745,"name":"Saurabh Jain","active":1}},{"user":{"id":888734,"name":"Goonjan Jain","active":1}}],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":5,"review_text":"Try the tea leaf salad, samusa or just anything else on the menu, its bound to be good.

We enjoyed SuperStar Vegetarian noodles which was made of flat noodles, stir fried brocoli, some other seasonal veggies and garlic.\nThe kitchen was about to close and we couldn't order much.\nWould love to go back here on our next visit.","id":28971043,"restaurant_id":16841211,"rating_color":"3F7E00","review_time_friendly":"Dec 17, 2016","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Dec 17, 2016","rating_text":"Loved it!","timestamp":1481973088,"review_time":"2016-12-17 16:41:28","liked_by_user":0,"likes":0,"user":{"id":125539,"name":"Anjali Bhat","zomato_handle":"Spinyourspoon","foodie_level":"Big Foodie","foodie_level_num":6,"foodie_color":"ffae4f","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":62,"no_of_beenthere":26,"no_of_reviews":26,"no_of_followers":83,"no_of_follows":19,"no_of_photos":127,"no_of_media":127,"no_of_favorites":19,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"facebook","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/45a\/35aa1cbcc41c724568fb378f50c4545a.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/45a\/35aa1cbcc41c724568fb378f50c4545a.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"Anjali Bhat","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":5,"review_text":"Came to San Fran for a short trip, and this restaurant was recommended by my uber driver. Turned out that he was right, this place was beyond my expectation! \nCame for a Monday dinner, we arrived around 4:45pm, there were ppl waiting outside. Luckily, we got in quickly.\nThis was my first time trying Burmese food, so I was pretty curious about this unfamiliar cuisine. \nTea leaf salad: sliced fresh romaine lettuce, fried crunchy yellow beans,onion pieces,sunflower seeds, peanuts ,diced tomato and green pepper; of course, can't miss the special sauce made of imported Burmese tea leave. after adding some lemon juice and tossed to combine, the salad was ready to eat. Have to say, it was really good! Love the combination of freshness and crunchiness, the sauce was light and tasty. So curious how they made it! \nChicken samusas(3p): this dishes was influenced by Indian cuisine. They filled with curry potato, chicken meat and some spices, tasted just like normal good quality samusas, but with visible large pieces of chicken meat! \nChili lamb: thinly cut pieces of lamb meat stir fried with dry chillies, onion and basil. This dish was has strong cumin spice in it and little bit hot. The meat was perfect and sauce was tasty, however, it was too salt. It's better to have it with plain rice.\nPumpkin pork stew:it's a stew, not a curry dish. The pork meat was pretty lean and tender, so as the pumpkin(the flesh was dry, sweet,even kind of creamy to me, love it!) The sauce was very tasty yet not feel heavy at all! \nNan Gyi Dok(coconut chicken rice noodle): round rice noodle with coconut curry sauce tossed together with chicken meat, egg, fried yellow beans and crispy wonton chips. The sauce was mild spicy, and creamy. Not bad! \nWe finished the nice dinner with coconut pudding fritters with ice cream. The pudding was coated with batter and deep fried. Well, it was not amazing since I still felt little bit heavy. Also the ice cream was too sweet. \nLast but not least, you have to order some coconut rice! It was so~~~~~good! Rice was cooked very soft, tasted salty and sweet, very well balanced, and it was perfect to have with your main dishes! \nWhen you get the bill, you will like the restaurant even more! The value of the money was very good too! No wonder Burma superstar had such high review scores! If I have the chance, I will definitely go back for more yummy Burmese food! \n","id":27469854,"restaurant_id":16841211,"rating_color":"305D02","review_time_friendly":"Jun 26, 2016","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Jun 26, 2016","rating_text":"Insane!","timestamp":1466919390,"review_time":"2016-06-26 11:06:30","liked_by_user":0,"likes":1,"user":{"id":23702736,"name":"Jianierrrrrr","zomato_handle":"Jianierrrrrr","foodie_level":"Connoisseur","foodie_level_num":13,"foodie_color":"e95151","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":1331,"no_of_beenthere":336,"no_of_reviews":255,"no_of_followers":357,"no_of_follows":0,"no_of_photos":2191,"no_of_media":2191,"no_of_favorites":0,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"facebook","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/eec\/2894924b56aae68554c8dbe4c6976eec.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/eec\/2894924b56aae68554c8dbe4c6976eec.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"Jianierrrrrr","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":1},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":4.5,"review_text":"If you have never tried Burmese food, then make sure your first time would be in Burma Superstar.

Tea Leaf Salad --- I hate tea with a fiery passion. I refuse to drink, look at, or be in the same room as the stuff. That said, I love Burma Superstar's signature Tea Leaf Salad, a delicious appetizer of Iceberg Lettuce (yuck), dried shrimp (yuck again), fried yellow beans (yum), garlic, sesame, jalapenos, tomatoes, and, of course, imported fermented tea leaves. The last of the aforementioned shopping list of ingredients that goes into each salad is easily the most special; each leaf comes hand-picked, hand-fermented, and hand-delivered from Burma itself. Though not everyone's cup of tea (kneeslapper), this salad's bombastic flavors meld together to create around 100 memorable bites. Nearly every texture - crunchy (beans), squishy (tomatoes), soft (tea leaves) - and flavor - spicy (jalapenos), smoky (sesame), bitter (tea leaves again) - can be picked out of the plate. It is essentially a work of art, a dish that earns its praise and deserves every good word said about it.\n\r\n\r-----21 Aug, 2014-----\n\rBraised Pork belly (dish review). Braised Pork Belly --- Pork belly (especially of the braised variety), is one of my favorite treats. Though it can be found smoked or grilled in the Americas and Europe, few continents cook it up quite like Asia does. Burma Superstar's superstar pork dish is a Chinese take on the classic protein, featuring a sweet garlic glaze and mustard greens. The meat itself is tender, coated in spice and sesame, and cut to highlight the succulent layer of fat that makes pork belly the world's worst for your waistline. This dish is made better by its price (a reasonable $17) and its size (one plate can serve as a main course for two), but it can surely rest on taste alone.\n\r\n\r-----21 Aug, 2014-----\n\rBurma Superstar (Burmese\/Asian). Burma Superstar, San Francisco's bastion of Southeast Asian cuisine that ends in &quot;-ese&quot; yet doesn't start with &quot;Viet&quot;, is one of my new favorites in The City. This star of Clement Street's little-known Chinatown serves up some delicious dishes made with only the freshest ingredients. Highlighting the pretty short, yet diverse menu is the Burmese Lamb Curry, a bowl of succulent, meaty morsels topped with spices, curry powder, and roasted potatoes. A second favorite is the Braised Pork Belly (actually a Chinese dish), a platter of crispy and fatty meat cooked in five spice and natural juices. Aside from the food, the service and atmosphere are both fairly spectacular, with knowledgeable staff and varying displays of Burmese art. Parking is easier on Mars, but you already knew that (SF is SF, after all). Wait times can range from one to two hours long (with lines that stretch for blocks), so be sure to arrive early and ready to order. Line length aside, Burma Superstar stands out in a city known for excellent ethnic fare; if you're in the Richmond District, few places around are better.\r\n\r\nRating: 8.8\/10","id":16635985,"restaurant_id":16841211,"rating_color":"3F7E00","review_time_friendly":"Aug 21, 2014","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Aug 21, 2014","rating_text":"Loved it!","timestamp":1408640534,"review_time":"2014-08-21 22:32:14","liked_by_user":0,"likes":2,"user":{"id":21711410,"name":"Taste.","zomato_handle":"tastesf","foodie_level":"Connoisseur","foodie_level_num":13,"foodie_color":"e95151","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":304,"no_of_beenthere":609,"no_of_reviews":511,"no_of_followers":258,"no_of_follows":168,"no_of_photos":545,"no_of_media":545,"no_of_favorites":168,"is_verified":1,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"email","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/102\/1fcb35e045f8dbd2797ef81d18328102.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/102\/1fcb35e045f8dbd2797ef81d18328102.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"http:\/\/tasteperiod.blogspot.com","template_text":"Taste.","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":0,"review_text":"Food is not really authentic but made to resemble of it.

They really seemed to want to insure we had an enjoyable dining experience.\r\n\r\nMy friend had been there before. After we discussed the menu, she did the ordering and we shared everything.\r\n\r\nShe selected the following dishes:\r\n\r\nVegetable Samosas\r\nCalamari\r\nTea Leaf Salad\r\nGarlic Chili Shrimp\r\nSpicy Chicken with Basil\r\nSesame Beef\r\n\r\nI am going to simply divide the food into Excellent and Very Good. We enjoyed each dish.\r\n\r\nExcellent:\r\nCalamari\r\nTea Leaf Salad\r\nGarlic Chili Shrimp\r\n\r\nVery Good:\r\nVegetable Samosas\r\nSpicy Chicken w Basil\r\nSesame Beef\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a wonderful dining experience. The food combined with the friendly and warm service combined together for a near perfect meal.","id":16635973,"restaurant_id":16841211,"rating_color":"CBCBCB","review_time_friendly":"Jul 05, 2011","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Jul 05, 2011","rating_text":"Not rated","timestamp":1309822746,"review_time":"2011-07-05 05:09:06","liked_by_user":0,"likes":0,"user":{"id":21376025,"name":"MarkSF","zomato_handle":"","foodie_level":"Connoisseur","foodie_level_num":13,"foodie_color":"e95151","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":222,"no_of_beenthere":468,"no_of_reviews":341,"no_of_followers":137,"no_of_follows":112,"no_of_photos":792,"no_of_media":792,"no_of_favorites":112,"is_verified":1,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"facebook","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/0d4\/1b7bbe21116891593ec14005c65190d4.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/0d4\/1b7bbe21116891593ec14005c65190d4.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"MarkSF","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":0,"review_text":"Forkin Great.
