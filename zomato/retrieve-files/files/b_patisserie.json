Try their coffees and crumpets.. that will make your morning. If you are close to thanksgiving and need a pie from them order a few days earlier so you can go early on thanksgiving day to pick up. The lines are long that day and they do make extras in case you haven't ordered prior but you have to be there by 8am. The line goes around the corner of the building.",

I tried the Kouign-Amman, and it didn't disappoint, with layers of delicate puff pastry with a dab of chocolate in the middle. I got a banana croissant to go while walking out, in hindsight should have gotten a plain croissant, I think you shouldn't mess with the originals!! But overall a great spot for french pastries and baked goods. I'll be back for sure.",

Very busy so you have time to look around, but that doesn't make choosing any easier. Counter service is remarkably fast and efficient. The muffuletta tartine blende all of the flavors of the New Orleans classic including olive salad just like the Central Grocery, but open-faced version is light, delicious, and absolutely unique. Only one word for the almond banana croissant - YUM. But the highlight was the signature kouign-amann. Puff pastry with a crystalline caramelized outside like a palmier and a sweet, syrupy inside unlike anything you've ever tasted. If that is not enough to satisfy your sweet tooth, you can also try the very-filled version. Of course, you can and should get a box or two of other selections, including the rainbow-colored macarons. Guaranteed you'll be back.",
