I chose the Morning Bun, Pain au Chocolat, and Gougere. The Morning Bun was dusted with cinnamon sugar and had hints of candied orange zest. While the flavours were good, the texture was drier than I had anticipated. I only wished that the interior was softer and fluffier. The pastry of the Pain au Chocolat wasn't as light and flaky as the one from Mr. Holmes Bakehouse, and the chocolate filling wasn't as tasty as others that I've had. I did, however, enjoy the Gougere. It was unique - a savoury egg dough with Gruyere, thyme, and black pepper. Of the three, I would certainly order the Gougere again.&nbsp;\nTartine wasn't a disappointment by any means but I had greater expectations for this San Francisco landmark.","id":26876732,"restaurant_id":16851686,"rating_color":"5BA829","review_time_friendly":"Apr 23, 2016","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Apr 23, 2016","rating_text":"Great!","timestamp":1461351512,"review_time":"2016-04-23 00:28:32","liked_by_user":0,"likes":0,"user":{"id":21526738,"name":"Jessica Tong","zomato_handle":"jessicatong","foodie_level":"Super Foodie","foodie_level_num":8,"foodie_color":"f58552","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":196,"no_of_beenthere":412,"no_of_reviews":64,"no_of_followers":68,"no_of_follows":6,"no_of_photos":192,"no_of_media":192,"no_of_favorites":6,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"facebook","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/df0\/57293473a27298393937343cb27dcdf0.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/df0\/57293473a27298393937343cb27dcdf0.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"Jessica Tong","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":1},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":4.5,"review_text":"This place is an institution so I really should have tried more on this trip.
