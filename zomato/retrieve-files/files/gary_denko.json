Obviously everyone has their personal tastes, but there was a huge difference in quality between dishes. A few dishes we got were outstanding (mainly the appetizers), while many were meh and sub-par. \n\nIf you are gonna eat here multiple times, I think you just gotta experitement to find which dishes are the best.",

Food was served at just the right pace. My wifes water glass almost got empty, once, and never again. All servers, managers, assistants worked to make this an exceptional experience. Two days before we dined, they retained their Michelin star. We have eaten in other restaurants, the Jules Verne, La Mer, Alan Wongs, and several others and this ranked right up with the best. Food was wonderful. We ate different things so were able to sample each others dishes, and found none of the lacking. Surprises at the end of the meal, were delightful. Again, Andrew and his team were absolutely GREAT!",

                "review_text": "Man oh man, where do I even begin... *O*\n\nUpon arriving, we were seated promptly at a table side-by-side. It was obvious that the space of the restaurant is small, and this was their modish attempt to save some room. It was totally fine though because I love dining *next* to my boyfriend just as much as across from him :p&nbsp;\n\nA wait staff came over straightaway with a wine menu for us to look over. Although the wine menu was super extensive, it was well organized and easy for me to pick one fairly quickly. Another wait staff came by to offer us the current food menu and explained quickly the &quot;rules&quot; which is that there aren't really any -- you can pick and choose from any section for your 3, 4, or 5-course meals and they adjust the portions accordingly. We opted to get a 4 course meal each, one from each of the sections anyway and it was plenty filling for both of us. After everything was ordered, another wait staff came by with the half bottle of wine that I had ordered and allowed me to try some first before I got &quot;stuck&quot; with it. In general, I knew that I liked Cabs and red blends so I knew the blend that I picked wouldn't do me any injustice -- one small taste later and both our wine glasses were appropriately filled with delicious red wine.&nbsp;\n\nThe wait staff rotated constantly so we weren't able to &quot;bond&quot; with one, but that's OK too because maybe they figured out how to be the most efficient in a small space -- everyone was extremely attentive and professional, and knowledgeable of both the food menu and wine menu and despite our indecisiveness, we were quickly able to choose quickly with a bit of their help. Our food came out quickly and our plates were cleaned off and reset based on the dish we selected.\n\n* * * Appetizers * * *&nbsp;\n// Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Summer Squash\nThis was so yummy, I love seafood and so shrimp/dungeness crab risotto was the obvious choice for me for the first course. My boyfriend took a small bite and enjoyed it as well. Funnily, even though he's extremely allergic to shrimp, this was the dish he craved the next day.\n// Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Cherries&nbsp;\nActually my first time that I tried foie gras -- This was a small but appropriately portioned, juicy, fatty, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Definitely one of those things you indulge in once in awhile to spoil yourself. Must-try if you've never tried foie gras!!&nbsp;\n\n* * * Fish and Seafood * * *&nbsp;\n//Roast Maine Lobster\nMore seafood, my 2nd course pick. The lobster was so fresh, so tender. This set the new standard for all things seafood for me... The texture was absolutely perfect, but unfortunately the meaty part was probably only the size of my finger. Until next time..&nbsp;\n//Horseradish Crusted Salmon Medallion with Dilled Cucumbers and Mustard Sauce&nbsp;\nHm, I generally really enjoy Salmon, unfortunately (or fortunately) everything else was so exquisite that the salmon was largely overshadowed and I don't recall it being super out-of-this world. Perhaps sea bass would have been the better choice here.\n\n* * * Meat and Game Birds * * *\n//Juniper Crusted Bison with King Trumpet Mushrooms\nMmm bison. Another first for me... Actually I may have tried this in an exotic sausage or something (heh..heh) This was cooked to perfection, rare and juicy on the inside, cooked and seasoned intensely flavorful on the outside. This was also a win for me.\n//Lemon Pepper Duck Breast with Duck Hash, Bacon Braised Endive and Port Glazed Cherries&nbsp;\nI don't usually go for duck. I'm perfectly happy with chicken, but this... was pretty much life-changing. They sliced the mound of duck breast thinly but each thin slice still managed to retain its flavors. I was honestly pretty surprised how much I liked this! Good recommendation from our waiter to get this over the pork!&nbsp;\n\n* * * Desserts * * *&nbsp;\n//Trio of Cr&egrave;me Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e with Assorted Cookies\nWho doesn't love cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e?? And it comes with 3 different types..? Sold!\n//Lemon Souffl&eacute; Cake with Cr&egrave;me Fra&icirc;che Panna Cotta and Raspberry Sorbet&nbsp;\nThe tartness of the lemon helped balance out the sweetness of this one, however it was still a tad sweeter than I would have preferred. Ending up taking this home and had it the next afternoon anyway because this was still heavenly to these taste buds.&nbsp;\n\nDessert-wise... My *complimentary* birthday chocolate mousse was surprisingly my favorite here, and I'm not even normally a chocolate-loving person (too sweet 90% of the time). However, their rendition of a chocolate cake/mousse seems to have been made with a flawless blend of rich dark chocolate and other ingredients that I became unreservedly in love with its divine taste. As if the complimentary birthday cake wasn't enough, they also brought us a small platter of assorted cookies (petit fleurs), AND gave us each a pineapple breakfast muffin to have the next morning!! From service to ambiance to the food selection and quality, everything was A+++.",

We had originally planned to go in June for a special occasion, but we had to postpone several times until we finally were able to go. The restaurant reservation staff was most accommodating, part of what makes for an outstanding experience.\n\nThe menu offers a wide range of choices from appetizers through dessert, with the meal price based on whether you order three, four, or five items. Three was quite enough for us, especially when you add in the amuse-bouche, bread, and wine. But if this is your once-in-a-lifetime trip to the restaurant, then you should by all means order more. Also, you shouldn't view the menu as constraining you - they gladly accommodated my wife's preferences, and I know from past experience that the kitchen is willing to prepare something not on the menu, at least within reason.\n\nWe were very pleased with every aspect of the dinner, and also with our good fortune in finding a street parking space close to the restaurant, thus saving us the $20 valet parking charge, which was better spent in the restaurant. If the weather is OK and you are able to walk, it's definitely worth checking for a space, though you should carefully check the legality of anything that you find, since parking tickets cost as much as the dinner.\n\nWe waited too long to return to Gary Danko, and have thus already made a reservation for a date in February, two months from now.",

We visited on a Thursday night and even 2 months out only had an early sitting available (6pm).\n\nIt was romantic with mood lighting and lots of waiters taking care of you.\n\nThe menu is a set price for 3, 4 or 5 courses but you get to choose each meal as against a degustation-style menu. The only stipulation was you had to order all courses at the beginning of the meal.\n\nWe had the 3 course options and the price was relatively affordable when compared to some degustation meals we've enjoyed.\n\nThe food was all very good. My sweet corn soup was extraordinary and my seafood thai curry was gorgeous. The style of presentation came with a bit of theatre which added to the specialness of the night.\n\nMy friend's pork dish was a bit mixed, the belly gorgeous but the tenderloin not so.\n\nDesserts were good. I had the triple br&ucirc;l&eacute;e which was yum and my wife the three ice cream sandwiches that were also good.\n\nI always enjoy having a sommelier manage the wine and ours did a stellar job recommending wines that suited both our palates and choice of meals. My only disappointment was that for the white wine we were charged by the glass when we had requested a bottle. I thought that strange. It was $20 more expensive that way and also we wondered whether we had an extra glass available.\n\nIt was also nice being in a restaurant where everyone was dressed up. Jackets and/or ties were common and ladies wearing lovely dresses. It's rare these days with the casualisation of eateries.\n\nThe 2 sittings mean that if you have an early one you won't get to linger over your courses as the large number of waiters sure deliver each course quickly. We were out by 8pm.\n\nWe would happily recommend the restaurant and hope to make it back one day when next in SF.",

Your dining experience will be simply impeccable. \n\nThis is local GEM in San Francisco. Amazing service beyond your imagination - amazing foods beyond your imagination and all worth every cent you spend. \n\nVenue:\n\nExperience\n\nExcellent place to dine-in we've eaten in a lot of fine dining restaurants around the world and this is one of the best. The food was out of this world. It's was my friend&rsquo;s birthday the day that we visited and they had made a little cake for her which was a lovely touch. The staffs were very professional and friendly. The only criticism I could make was the tables were rather close together and the fact that there appeared to be only the one unisex toilet, which in a busy restaurant is a little unusual. Overall thought it was a wonderful night.\n\nA neighborhood favorite and my go-to spots for all my fancy out-of-town guests, I truly have never had a bad experience here. They always manage to make their patrons feel extra special. Whether that's addressing you by name, remembering what you ordered or for what special occasion came for, they really do make you feel like you're part of the family.\n\nI loved the extensive wine list from all over the world from the old world reds and whites of Europe to the fruitier new world wine selections of California and beyond, the pairings are just endless. \n\nSome notable items were the scallops, Moroccan spiced squab, bass, and the cheese cart. If you are there for a special occasion, they will usually bring out a little special dessert for you - happened for my parent's anniversary, a few birthdays, and an engagement party.\n\nNeedless to say, you are paying for the quality of the food and the excellence of the service. Nothing gets overlooked here and everything is done with a purpose. \n\nPrice: 250",

You can do a la cart or choose from 3, 4, or 5 courses and the best part of that you can choose from anything off the menu and they will proportion your meal. Great cheese selections as well. The atmosphere is very relaxed and not snobbish type of fine dining feel. We even got a take home gift. Will be back again.",

I'm not a person who is always comfortable in really fancy restaurants, but I wanted to try the amazing food I had heard about, so I made a reservation.\r\n\r\nWhen we first got there, we had to wait quite a bit for our table. They never let us get upset, though, sending us free drinks and little bites &quot;from the chef&quot; that included a wonderful warm salmon on a crisp bread round, topped with caviar. Everyone from the bartender to the waiters, etc., kept walking up to us and apologizing profusely and offering to bring us something else on the house.\r\n\r\nThey have a wonderful fixed price menu, where you can order the 3-, 4- or 5-course meal and get anything on the menu in it. We got the 5-course for around $90 each (we decided to splurge). My husband and I got something different for each course so we could try each other's food, and they were ALL amazing. One course after another was cooked perfectly and just amazing to taste. They portions were just right for five courses, which, for us, included a dessert and cheese course.\r\n\r\nThe service was amazing from the first minute we sat down. I never felt uncomfortable or condescended to, as can happen in restaurants of this caliber. I felt comfortable asking questions about what certain items on the menu were, and the waiter knew all of the answers. Quite impressive! I think they were had spy cameras or something, because our empty plates never sat long in front of us, and it was clearly a well-oiled machine working to bring us utensils, etc., for the next course.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the meal, they brought us a wonderful chocolate dessert with &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; artfully written on the plate in chocolate. By this time, there weren't many people left eating, but we never felt rushed. After that, the waiter brought us a tray full of little dessert bites, telling us the chef had been experimenting with things and wanted us to try them on the house. We also were plied with muffins, wine bottle openers and other swag on our way out, the different employees *still* apologizing for how long we had to wait. Throughout the night, we were comped all of our drinks and quite a bit of food in what seemed an attempt to make up for our having to wait what, at most, was a half-hour wait. And hey, it worked! We were thrilled with our overall experience, and we have told everyone we know going out to San Francisco since then.",

They serve the same menu there and the waiter/bartender was fantastic. The food was incredible, I will dream of the glazed oysters for a long time. My husband and I agreed that this was among the best meals we have ever eaten (and we love food and eat out regularly). The next time I know I'll be in SF, I'll be sure to get a table well in advance. Can't wait!",

Foodie friends of ours said it was too bad we wouldn't get to go here but we pulled offa miracle and squeezed in - at 10:30pm on a Wednesday.\r\n\r\nIt was worth it. Truly, one of the best meals I have ever had. I had a gastric bypass a few years ago and, as a result, my pace for eating is slower than most. Either that, or I can manager about 2 bites which I was NOT going to do here! They served us nice and slow as we were ready. They were exceptional with handing my shellfish allergy even to the point of getting us new amuse-bouche that didn't include caviar! \r\nThe corn chowder was one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life and worth the price of admission alone. The itty bitty biscuit and the way it fairly melted into the steaming milk...the stuff of gourmet dreams! \r\nThe service was impeccable even though we were the last folks there. Lovely people, amazing food. Money be damned - this is worth every penny.",

It was a big night out for us and we chose this restaurant based on all the great reviews. First of all the, atmosphere was very dated, but we were completely willing to overlook this as we were really just there for the food. The service was very good (but certainly not the best around). The food was all clearly made of high quality ingredients but the flavors were not very well integrated. Each component of each dish was kept separate (I think for the sake of presentation) which left me trying to compose my own mini dish for each bite. Even then I thought most dishes were lacking in creativity and flavor. I have had much better meals in San francisco for a fraction of the price. I will give them this, I have a number of food sensivities and the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful in identifying items to avoid or making a minor modification if possible.",

So book well in advance if you have something special coming up and want to make the date.\r\n\r\nFood was as flavorful as it was well crafted. You could not ask for a better dining experience. Pork, duck, lobster and soft shell crab were all wonderful. Portion sizes are nice and you will not go hungry. Cherry and chocolate souffl&eacute;s were delicious. \r\n\r\nCheese selections were excellent, you know it's going to be a good dinner when you find out they have a well-stocked cheese cart!!! I am a Foie Gras fiend always looking for my next best Foie Gras experience! GD did not disappoint me! It was delicious, not to thick just right.\r\n\r\nWine list is well rounded and covers a selection that will please all; price range is on the high side. Sommelier Jeff Anderson was excellent, engaging and knowledgeable. I so look forward to my next dinner at GD.",

I can honestly say I was excited about each course; everything sounded so appetizing and creative. The food was unreal-- but the experience was just as fantastic. It was a whole sensory adventure from the ambiance to the presentation to the aroma and then of course, the flavor. The service has to be the best service of any restaurant I have ever been to, and there is an attention to detail that is rare. I felt like a celebrity getting special treatment, but I know they treat everyone that way. In New York, we ate at Gramercy Tavern which was about the same price ($250 for two, including tip) but we were so disappointed about the experience after our expectations were set so high (we'd heard a lot about it when we visited). No meal can even hold a candle to the night at Gary Danko. GO THERE!",

Break from my little adventures to take you into a...\r\n\r\ndegustation of desire.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars.\r\n\r\nTo start, an amuse bouche of carrot ginger soup, a hint of creme fraiche, rich curry, and littered with perfect mushroom cubes. Garnished with parsley.\r\n\r\nNext, pan seared sonoma valley foie gras, firm and plump sittting atop a compote of caramelized red onions, and rhubarb softened in... red onions...perhaps? Garnished with beautiful flowing greens.\r\n\r\nMushroom dusted sea scallops with english pea puree, shimeji mushrooms, and meyer lemon. The scallops are fat and juicy, tender with sinking meat, and in a subtle, but beautiful, pea puree.\r\n\r\nQuail stuffed foie gras, leeks and quinoa, garro, maitake mushrooms, zucchini and roasted red peppers nestled in a compilation of quinoa and maitake mushrooms and roasted red peppers. Zucchini curls garnish the plate and add coolness.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the meal is quick, fast and good. The tempo picks up as the dishes grow richer, and spanish guitar quietly spinning through the air.\r\n\r\nLemongrass soda, housemade jalapeno syrup, muddles with basil, makes a light and spicy refreshing drink between the meat course and the fromage.\r\n\r\nPicandine pico affine, petit agur, la demon du midi, la vigneron with red grapes and raisin bread\r\n\r\nDessert, French earl grey macaroon with milk choice cream caramel sauce, lemon cream cheese ice cream huckleberry\r\n\r\nChocoate with coffee ice cream chocolate sauce\r\n\r\nMignardise to end.\r\n\r\nvoila. seduced you are. :)\r\n\r\nvideo reviews of degustations on my site http://www.tastytwosom... :) enjoy.\r\n\r\nTracy aka @tastytwosome on twitter. :)",

On my first visit, I pretty much expected the food to be perfectly prepared and expertly presented...it was. My dining companion had a gluten allergy, which was handled sensitively and without fuss, everything was a matter of course.My big surprise came when I departed...they had sent for my car when the presented the bill...the valet had it waiting for me when I left. What a pleasant surprise! Don't omit the cheese course...it was exquisite.",
