It&rsquo;s a small restaurant with tight seating and community staffing for ease of ordering\/delivery. The space was lively and filled with conversation but never to the point of interrupting your own. Walking in it feels like a local space, no fuss in decorations and instantly comfortable. We enjoyed the scallops and fried calamari for appetizers. The calamari came with two dipping sauces- a white aioli and Korean cocktail sauce, both delicious. For dinner we had the Alaskan halibut served over mushroom sauce with mashed potatoes. The meal was warm, flavorful, and a wonderful fusion. I would absolutely recommend The House for dinner but do be sure to get a reservation.

We had a reservation for 8 pm. After a quick drink at Vesuvio, we walked over to the House. We arrived pretty much right on time. We were quickly greeted and quickly seated. This is a small restaurant and the tables are pretty packed in.\r\n\r\nOur menus were brought to the table soon after. Our server came over and covered the specials (one of which they were out of). \r\n\r\nAfter bit of discussion, we were ready to order. \r\n\r\nStarters:\r\n\r\nWe selected the scallops special.\r\nAfter discussion, and some narrowing down, I selected the fried calamari.\r\n\r\nMains:\r\nShe selected the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy.\r\nI selected the Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce.\r\n\r\nDessert:\r\nWe selected a chocolate cake with espresso ice cream.\r\n\r\nWe shared all of the food.\r\n\r\nScallops - These were very good scallops. They had just that slight taste of the sea without having an overbearing flavor. They were well cooked. There was no hint of being rubbery. The greens worked well with the scallops. The lemon sauce was fresh and bright.\r\n\r\nCalamari - This was decent calamari. I did not think it was outstanding. Like the scallops, it was not rubbery. The breading could have used some more flavor. The small bitter salad served as a side was delicious.\r\n\r\nSea Bass - This was very good. It was flaky. It had just a touch of the flavor of being grilled. And once again, it had just a nice delicate flavor of the sea. I did not try the sides.\r\n\r\nPork Chop - This was one amazing pork chop. It was succulent and meaty. The pomegranate sauce was very good. Some might think it a touch too sweet but I did not. The asparagus and whipped potatoes made for a nice side.\r\n\r\nChocolate Cake - This was wonderful chocolate dessert. I enjoyed every bite. She liked it too.\r\n\r\nAs usual, we shared a bottle of red. I get 2\/3rds and she gets 1\/3. Lol, she is the driver. If I recall, this was a bottle of Anderson Valley.\r\n\r\nAmbiance - This is a simple small well kept room. Even with it's small size, it is still a comfortable space full of people enjoying their meals.\r\n\r\nService - I would say the service is professional and helpful. It is not robust or what I would call friendly. I did not find it rude just focused. I think it is a small restaurant and they need to turn tables over quickly. They focus on precision. There wasn't a lot of &quot;are you enjoying your meal?&quot; or &quot;can we get something else?&quot;.\r\n\r\nOverall - I was impressed. I think the food is the focus of the restaurant. It is not a flashy restaurant and the service is functional. I would not hesitate to return.","id":16647952,"restaurant_id":16844642,"rating_color":"CBCBCB","review_time_friendly":"Jun 02, 2011","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Jun 02, 2011","rating_text":"Not rated","timestamp":1306972351,"review_time":"2011-06-02 05:22:31","liked_by_user":0,"likes":1,"user":{"id":21376025,"name":"MarkSF","foodie_level":"Connoisseur","foodie_level_num":13,"foodie_color":"e95151","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":222,"no_of_beenthere":468,"no_of_reviews":341,"no_of_followers":137,"no_of_follows":112,"no_of_photos":792,"no_of_media":792,"no_of_favorites":112,"is_verified":1,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"facebook","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/0d4\/1b7bbe21116891593ec14005c65190d4.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/0d4\/1b7bbe21116891593ec14005c65190d4.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"MarkSF","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":0,"review_text":"NeIghborhood gem for YUM food.
