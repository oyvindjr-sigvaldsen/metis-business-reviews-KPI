What you need to know:\n\nDO NOT valet. They charge $15.00 (without tip)and while the valet guys were friendly, they drove our car with reckless abandon in front of us....Uber in San Francisco (taxis have a reputation for being unreliable) if you are a tourist without a car, use public transportation, or last option is to simply take advantage of the ample nearby public parking and walk.\n\nWhen you make your reservation, and you will definitely need one to get in unless you dine extremely early, request the back dining room. This restaurant is huge with a vibrant bar scene, which is in the front of the restaurant. The problem with the front is that if you are a party of two, you will be seated just a few inches away from another couple. \n\nThe rear of the restaurant is where the real action is: a lively, international crowd and clearly the place where the &quot;insiders&quot; go.\n\nOne of the wonderful things, besides the divine cuisine, about Kokkari's is our server made note of our preference, and the hostess entered it under our Open Table profile on our way out.\n\nOur server was a young woman who I doubted had the ability to help us pick our a wine. And, was I happily proven wrong. She was not only attentive and knowledgable, but she picked a Greek wine for us based on our normal preferences of California and French reds. We were so impressed that we had her order an array of dishes for us, and were swooning as we ate this absolute peerless Greek food. \n\nOrder at least 4-5 dishes off the Mezethes menu &amp; share. They will happily prepare half versions of all dishes, including entrees. This is fresh, aromatic, mouth-watering food. Refuse the bread &amp; olive oil, and order the house made, grilled pita!\n\nWe had: Feta sto Fourno-Greek feta baked in tomato, capers, and brandy...need I say more? Smear the feta and sauce on your pita, eat, and allow the yummy sounds to resonate your immediate pleasure!\n\nKolokithokeftethes-zucchini cakes with mint, cucumber-yogurt dressing. This is not your typical Greek restaurant food. The cool of the yogurt dressing with the warm and flavorful zucchini cakes is one of those perfect combinations. The Greek wine was perfect with everything, and we so enjoyed trying something new!\n\nI am a vegetarian, and my friend a hearty carnivore and this is the perfect combination of both. He got a half order of Arnisia Paidakia-lamb chops &amp; potatoes while I had the Spanakotiropita-and don't think, unless you have been to Greece that you have had this dish before. I have had it many times, and made it, and this was truly fabulous. The herbs, as with all of the dishes, were fresh and full of flavor. This is the quintessential mnu where flavors not only marry, but they dance together on your palate.\n\nThe place got too busy, and we waited too long for dessert. They apologized, &amp; served us a delectable plate of Greek cookies and a dessert wine on the house.\n\nThey love what they do, and it is obvious. \n\nWe can't wait to return!!","id":28153240,"restaurant_id":16845743,"rating_color":"3F7E00","review_time_friendly":"Sep 08, 2016","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Sep 08, 2016","rating_text":"Loved it!","timestamp":1473279201,"review_time":"2016-09-08 01:43:21","liked_by_user":0,"likes":0,"user":{"id":35857284,"name":"Jaspreet Narula","zomato_handle":"amazingfoodiegurl","foodie_color":"e95151","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":70,"no_of_beenthere":149,"no_of_reviews":141,"no_of_followers":3253,"no_of_follows":2498,"no_of_photos":1921,"no_of_media":1921,"no_of_favorites":2498,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"others","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/b26\/97b504e6fb07cca6417fefcac3471b26.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/b26\/97b504e6fb07cca6417fefcac3471b26.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"Jaspreet Narula","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":4,"review_text":"#Aprondiaries\n\nClassy decor, pricey menu and exclusive clientele go there.

Kokkari has long been a favorite of mine, both at the bar and in the main dining room. The lamb riblets are to die for. But I want to focus on one of their recent lunch specials, Pork Souvlaki-pita. The pork was being roasted on the spit for lunch that day and looked and smelled amazing. As the souvlaki pita was the special, it seemed the natural thing to order. The lamb and chicken souvlaki are regular menu items for lunch. \r\n\r\nI almost take for granted that the pork would be cooked properly roasting on a spit for hours and it was. What stood out was the pita. Not a flimsy paper thin piece of dry bread, but a wonderfully fresh, thick and seasoned compliment to the pork. Inside the Wrap of Life was thinly sliced red union, tzatziki, and tomato. The pita was presented initially with a large 'skewer' of rosemary to hold the wrapped pita's shape. The pita held its shape with each and every bite, even after I put it back on the plate. As will commonly happen with a variety of pedestrian street offerings of souvlaki pita, a foil wrap is the only thing keeping your lunch from making a mess of your clothes. Make no mistake, the souvlaki was moist from the pork and condiments and had a generous ooze from the bottom of the pita.\r\n\r\nI look forward to trying their lamb and chicken varieties.","id":16651273,"restaurant_id":16845743,"rating_color":"CBCBCB","review_time_friendly":"Sep 19, 2010","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Sep 19, 2010","rating_text":"Not rated","timestamp":1284919011,"review_time":"2010-09-19 23:26:51","liked_by_user":0,"likes":0,"user":{"id":21230962,"name":"The Cured Ham","foodie_level":"Connoisseur","foodie_level_num":12,"foodie_color":"e95151","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":54,"no_of_beenthere":312,"no_of_reviews":54,"no_of_followers":152,"no_of_follows":125,"no_of_photos":125,"no_of_media":125,"no_of_favorites":125,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"facebook","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/99f\/a0ab5ad4dd64ac3fc334d04dae2e799f.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/99f\/a0ab5ad4dd64ac3fc334d04dae2e799f.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"http:\/\/www.thecuredham.com","template_text":"The Cured Ham","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":0,"review_text":"The Best Octopus.

It's so yummy!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nWe had Appetizers. Oh! I love both of them. I just can say &quot; Wow..wwwwwwww &quot;\r\nOctopodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano, &amp; olive oil \r\nSomehow grilled octopus and salted with ouzo taste better when eaten by sea.\r\nGarides Yuvetsi - wood oven roasted prawns with tomato &amp; feta cheese \r\n\r\nWhen in Greece, Eat lamb, So we did. There was an amazing.!!!!!!\r\nOur main course was lamp chops; Lamb chops cooked so tender, juicy, fantastic. My lamps were so great.

It is not overly sweet. It's just perfect!!!!\r\n\r\n* Kokkari's prices reflect this aspiration.
