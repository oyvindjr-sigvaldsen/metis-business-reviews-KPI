We came back on a Saturday, and were really hungry. We were at Hilton, returning the rented car. I quickly looked up in Zomato to find any restaurants nearby. It was 2:30 in the afternoon and most restaurants were closed. That's when I noticed this place, with great reviews and around 10 mins walk from Hilton.\n\nIt was drizzling and was really cold. This is the time when you look for some comfort food. But we were disappointed on reaching the place, it was really crowded, and people were waiting outside. We still decided to try our luck. I went in and wrote my name on the waiting list board. There were at least 10 people ahead of us. I was not so hopeful and we started searching again and almost decided to get a subway. But then suddenly the crowd reduced, looks like some people in the list didn't turn up.\n\nThere were no tables free, but was offered two bar chairs. We quickly accepted and I ordered Grillades &amp; Grits. Meat cooked well in a flavor rich gravy was ultimate! Mashed potatoes and toast were also good. It was accompanied with eggs any style and I ordered poached. Later I felt I should have gone for scrambled eggs, a better combination with toast.\n\nAmbience: 5\/5\nService: 5\/5\nFood: 5\/5\nValue for Money: 4\/5","id":43181419,"restaurant_id":16853056,"rating_color":"305D02","review_time_friendly":"10 months ago","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"10 months ago","rating_text":"Insane!","timestamp":1558600278,"review_time":"2019-05-23 14:01:18","liked_by_user":0,"likes":0,"user":{"id":188530,"name":"Gerin Jacob","zomato_handle":"gerinjacob","foodie_color":"ffd35d","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":2,"no_of_beenthere":22,"no_of_reviews":8,"no_of_followers":40,"no_of_follows":5,"no_of_photos":2,"no_of_media":2,"no_of_favorites":5,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"facebook","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/249\/042633ffd5b0ad9fecc6b76073fdf249.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/249\/042633ffd5b0ad9fecc6b76073fdf249.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"","template_text":"Gerin Jacob","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":5,"review_text":"Now this Creol in San Francisco..

They sat us pretty quick for a table of 7. Our waiter took our drink order and brought it out decently fast. When it came to ordering, our waitress got pretty frustrated with my wife's question about the pancakes, as she wanted to order one pancake for our 5 year old daughter. She told us there isn't a children's pancake, so my wife asked to order one pancake as a side dish to her meal instead and our waitress got this frustrated look and with an attitude said you can't do that. My brother in law then pointed out well why can't we just order the single pancake they have listed in the sides menu. She said well yeah you can that I guess. Seemed to me that she had an attitude like we were inconveniencing her by actually making her think about her job instead of just writing down orders. Waitresses are in customer service where the assistance of the customer is their sole purpose, and it seemed like she has lost sight of that. We finished ordering and then randomly our waitress changed to a different lady. Not sure if it had to do with our ordering, but usually when a waitress change happens, they explain it to you as introduce the one taking over, none of that happened. \n\nOur new waitress asked if we were going to add on the donut things and explained a little of what they were and we said sure. Our new waitress was already leaps and bounds better than the last. I expected under appetizers to come out first, as they did by about 10 seconds as our breakfast immediately followed. \n\nI had the steak strips with grits and 2 eggs, my wife had the special which was a type of sandwich with sausage, cheddar and eggs and spicy potatoes on the side, with my daughter getting the pancake. All of the food was very forgettable and underwhelming. My grits were bland with the steak strips having a very microwaved feel, like I was eating someone's leftover food from the night before. My eggs however were cooked as ordered. My wife didn't like her food, so I tasted it to get a personal feel. Her potatoes had a Franks hot sauce taste like someone just poured sauce on overcooked potatoes. They were not something I would ever choose again for sure. My daughter said her pancake was okay, but as a 5 year old who never complains about her food. My brother in law also got pancakes to split with his daughter so I asked him and he said they were not very good. \n\nWe then tried the beignets. My moms husband tried the crawfish one first and I about saw him spit it back out faster than you can say crawfish. The look on his face said stay far far away from them. I tried the chocolate one and it was okay. My mom seemed to like them ok, but definitely didn't blow us away. \n\nSummarized, expect hit and miss service with mediocre to pukish food. My friend who referred me here has been officially banned from giving me future advice.

You can stop reading now, because the rest of the review all boils down to that first sentence. You're still going? I admire your dedication. Speaking of dedication, no restaurant in the City is more dedicated to the art of Creole cuisine than Brenda's, a famed brunch spot with all the feel of a New Orleans' bistro. Each dish is crafted in traditional Southern style, with noticeable nods to the French origin behind it all. Jambalaya, &Eacute;touff&eacute;e, and Red Beans and Rice highlight a short menu that changes little between lunch and dinner. Four varieties of Beignet are offered all day, including a crawfish version that is among the best in the country. Perhaps the single brightest star is the Gumbo, a lovable stew of Chicken, Andouille, and Okra. Though it lacks the smokiness and deep roux I favor, Brenda's version brings back memories Paul Prudhomme's classic version popularized at Commander's Palace in NOLA. Buttermilk Fried Chicken might be the most popular item on the menu, though saying that hypes the dish up a little more than it deserves. The bird is delicious and crispy, but lacks the flavor and tenderness of some better Southern fried chicken recipes. Brenda's Shrimp and Grits, however, is perhaps second to none West of the Mississippi. While hot food is obviously Brenda's specialty, the other aspects of the restaurant are far from lacking. Oysters are one of the first things on the menu, and the sandwich section is filled with classics like Po Boys and Muffuletta. Every dish is worth its price, and comes in good portions served by friendly and helpful staff. This is one of those restaurant's you go to once in a lifetime if you don't have the privilege on living nearby, and is a spot that needs to be bookmarked for anyone's trip to San Francisco. Brenda's, with their legendary brunch, beloved Beignets, and stunning dinner menu, truly does New Orleans justice from 2,000 miles away.","id":26017793,"restaurant_id":16853056,"rating_color":"305D02","review_time_friendly":"Jan 16, 2016","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Jan 16, 2016","rating_text":"Insane!","timestamp":1452923813,"review_time":"2016-01-16 11:26:53","liked_by_user":0,"likes":3,"user":{"id":21711410,"name":"Taste.","zomato_handle":"tastesf","foodie_level":"Connoisseur","foodie_level_num":13,"foodie_color":"e95151","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":304,"no_of_beenthere":609,"no_of_reviews":511,"no_of_followers":258,"no_of_follows":168,"no_of_photos":545,"no_of_media":545,"no_of_favorites":168,"is_verified":1,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"email","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/102\/1fcb35e045f8dbd2797ef81d18328102.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/data\/user_profile_pictures\/102\/1fcb35e045f8dbd2797ef81d18328102.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":true,"thumb_exists":true},"blog_link":"http:\/\/tasteperiod.blogspot.com","template_text":"Taste.","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":4.5,"review_text":"Great unpretentious, authentic place.

Bottom line: the food is good but the service is horrible. I won't be going back. \r\n\r\nA family friend is moving away for good. To celebrate, we decided to take him to Brenda's. Big mistake. \r\n\r\nFirst offense, our waitress gave us the coldest reception imaginable. I'm not saying you have to bow or something crazy like that but at least pretend youre slightly happy customers are patronizing your establishment. \r\n\r\nSecond offense, she brought our check super early and without our request. We were not even half way done eating when she brought it. Our guest picked up on the vibe instantly saying &quot;who asked her for the check? are they trying to rush us out?&quot; yup, that's exactly what they were doing. \r\n\r\nThe bill was a little over 60 bucks. I placed 80 down since i didnt have change, and continued to eat and converse. She picked it up and said &quot;I'll be back with your change&quot; Honestly at that point I was going to let her keep the change which was well over 20%. I didn't let her know that though.\r\n\r\nFrom that point on I noticed that every waiter that passed gave us a weird look. Obviously wanting us to hurry and leave. The looks lingered more and more as time went on. I'm annoyed but chose to ignore it. After all it hadn't been a full hour since we were seated. I waited in line outside for longer than that. AND I was spending a decent amount of money. We were treating a guest and I was NOT about to be rushed. \r\n\r\nAnyways, the &quot;can we box this up for you?&quot; &quot;can we get anything else for you?&quot; visits from the waiter became more and more frequent coupled by the random walkby passive aggressive stares from other employees. Finally, a heavyset, dark haired waitress that we hadn't seen before comes over and removes everything from the table. This was the conversation that followed:\r\n\r\nWaitress: can we get something else for you?\r\nMe: no. We're fine thanks. \r\nWaitress: ok. Thanks for visiting us. (pause). BUUUBYE. (then she walked off with the same weird stare as if she wanted to say &quot;now get out&quot;)\r\n\r\nThat was the last straw. I called her back and reminded her that our original waitress never brought my change back. She seemed surprised; probably knowing that her attitude just cost her friend a tip. I removed everything from the change tray, placed it in my pocket, and left. \r\n\r\nThe service used to be great here but I guess in their success they've become arrogant. Maybe they figure their food is so good, they can afford to treat people anyway they choose and theyll keep coming back. Thats their prerogative, but I know at least four people they won't be seeing again.","id":16675531,"restaurant_id":16853056,"rating_color":"CBCBCB","review_time_friendly":"Sep 09, 2012","review_last_updated_time_friendly":"Sep 09, 2012","rating_text":"Not rated","timestamp":1347156482,"review_time":"2012-09-09 07:38:02","liked_by_user":0,"likes":0,"user":{"id":23125722,"name":"Justin","zomato_handle":"","foodie_level":"Foodie","foodie_level_num":1,"foodie_color":"ffd35d","prominent_color":"","no_of_ratings":0,"no_of_wishlists":0,"no_of_beenthere":1,"no_of_reviews":1,"no_of_followers":0,"no_of_follows":0,"no_of_photos":0,"no_of_media":0,"no_of_favorites":0,"is_verified":0,"user_type":"NORMAL","is_followed":0,"instagram_id":0,"instagram_access_token":"","instagram_user_name":"","instagram_profile_image":"","se_hidden":0,"login_type":"others","profile_image":{"large":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/images\/user_avatars\/pizza_2x.png?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","thumb":"https:\/\/b.zmtcdn.com\/images\/user_avatars\/pizza_2x.png?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A","large_exists":false,"thumb_exists":false},"blog_link":"","template_text":"Justin","online_ordering_enabled":true,"has_added_places":0},"deleted_flag":0,"tag_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"inline"},"with_struct_array":{"users":[],"tag_type":"normal"},"important_flag":0,"impressions":"","is_active":1,"translation_allowed":false,"comments_count":0,"management_comments_count":0,"comments_count_unique_users":0,"all_comments_count":0}},{"review":{"rating":0,"review_text":"So disappointed in my breakfast here =(.

Great service, classy decor, and, most importantly, spectacular breakfast food. Can't wait to go back for lunch! The shrimp and grits are a must for adventurous breakfast eaters like me.
